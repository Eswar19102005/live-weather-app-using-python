# ☁️ Live Weather App

A simple desktop application built with Python to fetch and display **real-time weather data** for any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. [cite_start]The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) developed with **Tkinter**[cite: 9].

## ✨ Features

* [cite_start]**Real-time Data:** Fetches current temperature, weather description, city, and country from a reliable meteorological source[cite: 6, 7].
* [cite_start]**User Interface:** A simple GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to easily input and search for a city[cite: 9, 51].
* [cite_start]**Comprehensive Information (Current):** Displays current temperature in Celsius and weather description (e.g., 'few clouds')[cite: 13, 70].
* [cite_start]**Location Search:** Allows manual search for weather information by city name[cite: 12].

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Python 3.x** - Core programming language.
* [cite_start]**requests** - Library used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**tkinter** - Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**OpenWeatherMap API** - Meteorological data source[cite: 28].

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the weather application locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* [cite_start]**requests** library (`pip install requests`)[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**An OpenWeatherMap API Key:** You must replace the placeholder key in the code with your own valid key[cite: 28, 29].

### Installation and Usage

1.  **Download the project code** (or clone the repository).
2.  **Install the requests library** if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  [cite_start]**Update the API Key:** Open your main Python script and replace the value of `API_KEY` with your personal key[cite: 28, 29].
4.  **Run the application** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python your_main_script_name.py
    ```
    [cite_start]*(The script is designed to create a live weather app and executed successfully for the test case provided)*[cite: 72, 73].
